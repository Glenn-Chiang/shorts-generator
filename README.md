# shorts-generator
A script that generates short videos with voice-over narration, background images and subtitles.

# How it works
- Generates a script using Google's Gemini AI API
  - The content of the script is controlled by the prompt found in `prompt.txt`
  - Feel free to try modifying the prompt to generate scripts with different types of content
  - However, do not modify the part of the prompt that controls the output format of the response, as doing so will likely break the script
- Generates voice-over narration of the script using Tiktok's unofficial text-to-speech API
- Fetches stock photos from Pexels API using search terms that are also generated by Gemini
- Compiles stock photos into a video using moviepy
- Generates subtitles with timestamps in .srt format using the AssemblyAI speech-to-text API
- Burns subtitles into the video and adds the voice-over audio using moviepy
